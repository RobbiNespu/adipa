This theme is my personal project for my personal blog.

Use v0.9.9 if you want to use for your personal project because it's still using category instead of tag as main post/blog taxonomy. https://github.com/wiryawanadipa/adipa/releases/tag/v0.9.9

For live demo: https://wiryawanadipa.com only for v1.0.0++

Info about this theme:
1. Built in Wordpress version 6.0.2 (should be worked flawlessly from version 5.9.0) with PHP 7.4.30 and MariaDB 10.6.7 environment (if that matters)
2. Bootstrap 5.2.0 (grid system) & custom CSS
3. Font Awesome 6.1.2 (free version) for icon
4. Poppins Font
5. Theme color #36454f with #fc5c65 and #eb3b5a accent
6. Custom theme settings (BETA)
7. Custom admin page font (Using poppins font)
8. Custom login page theme color
9. Classic Editor Theme exclusive
10. It's responsive!

Plan:
I may (or not) remove bootstrap in the future and use my own custom CSS or scss/sass. The reason I'm using Bootstrap in this theme is to practice my skill using CSS framework (I've never using CSS framework in the past, I always write my own CSS to design). That's why I'm still using my own custom CSS in some part.
