This theme is my personal project for my personal blog.

Use v0.9.9 if you want to use for your personal project because it's still using category instead of tag. https://github.com/wiryawanadipa/adipa/releases/tag/v0.9.9

For live demo: https://wiryawanadipa.com only for v1.0.0++

What is in this theme?
1. Built in Wordpress version 6.0.1
2. Bootstrap 5.2.0 (grid system) & custom CSS
3. Font Awesome 6.1.2 (free version) for icon
4. Poppins Font
5. Mogra Font
6. Theme color #36454f
7. Custom theme settings (BETA)
8. Custom admin font
9. Custom login page
10. It's responsive!

Plan:
I will remove bootstrap in the future and use my own custom CSS or scss/sass. The reason I'm using Bootstrap in this theme is to practice my skill using CSS framework (I've never using CSS framework in the past, I always write my own CSS to design). That's why I'm still using my own custom CSS in some part.
